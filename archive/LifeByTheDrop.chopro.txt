{t:Life by the Drop}
{st:Stevie Ray Vaughn}

Hello there, my old friend
Not so long ago it was til the end
We played outside in the pouring rain
On our way up the road we started over again

You're living our dream oh you on top
My mind is aching,  Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens living life by the drop

Up and down that road in our worn down shoes
Talking about good things and singing the blues
You went your way and I stayed behind
We both knew it was just a matter of time

(Chorus)

No wasted time, we're alive today
Churning up the past, there's no easier way
Time's been between us, a means to an end
God it's good to be here walking together my friend

We're living our dreams
My mind's stopped aching, 
That's how it happened living life by the drop
That's how it happened living life by the drop
That's how it happened living life by the drop
