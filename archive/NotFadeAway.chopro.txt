{t:Not fade away}
{st:Buddy Holly}

I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away

{cb: Lead: PJ}

My love is bigger than a cadillac
I try to show it but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away.
