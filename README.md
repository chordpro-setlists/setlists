# setlists

## To Do
* Make chords more visible in formatting for Kevin. (bold, blue, equal sized).
* Create sample TT setlist to distribute. (lyrics, no lyrics, KH's).
* Create config file for TOC title specification.
* Implement a GitHub action to run a gh-pages for the setlists/ directory.
* Maybe add an index.md with links to make it easier to retrieve.
* Make charts all start with YYMMDD so they sort nicely.
* Create a shell script to read the contents of the setlist file and generate individual pages.
