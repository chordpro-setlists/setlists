There's [E]mosquitoes on the river [A] [C], Fish are [E]rising up like birds [A] [C]
It's been [E]hot for seven weeks now, [A]too hot to even speak now,
Did you [E]hear what I just heard?

Say it might have been a fiddle, or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now, I can feel it in my feet now, listen here it comes again!

[A]There's a band out on the [Ao7]highway, [Bo7]they're high steppin' [A]into town
[A]It's a rainbow [Ao7]full of sound, it's [Bo7]fireworks, calliopes and [A]clowns.
Everybody [A6]dancin' [Bm7-5]   [A/C#]  [D#o7]  [Dm/F]  [A/C#]  [D7]  [E]

[A6]C'mon children, [Bm7-5]C'mon children, [A/C#]C'mon on clap your [D#dim7]hands. [D] [E]

[A]Sun went down in honey[D] [F] [G] and the [A]moon came up in wine, [D] [F] [G]
You know the [A]stars were spinnin' dizzy Lord the [D]band kept us so [F]busy.
[G]We for[D]got a[E]bout the [A]time. [E] [F#] [B]

They're a band beyond description, like Jehovah's favorite choir.
People joining hand in hand while the music played the band.  
Lord, they're setting us on fire.

Crazy rooster crowinâ€™ midnight, balls of lightin' roll along
Old men sing about their dreams, women laugh and children scream, 
And the band keeps playin' on.
{eov}

{sov: Bridge}
Keep on dancin' thru the daylight, greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone.
Was it ever here at all?   But they keep on dancin'
C'mon children, C'mon children, C'mon clap your hands
{eov}

{sov: V4}
Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday, and the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancin' full of singin' and romancin', 
The music never stopped.
{eov}
