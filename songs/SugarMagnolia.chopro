{sov: V1}
[A]Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming, head's all [G]empty and [E]I don't care,
[A]Saw my baby [C#m]down by the [F#m]river, [E]knew she'd have to come [D]up soon for [A]air.
{eov}

{sov: V2}
Sweet blossom come on, under the willow, we can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature, rolling in the rushes down by the riverside
{eov}

{sov: Chorus}
[D]She's got every[G]thing delightful, [D]she's got [A]everything I [D]need,
[D]Takes the wheel when [G]I'm seeing [D]double, pays my ticket [E]when I [A]speed
{eov}

Lead goes through verse chords
{eot}

{sov: V3}
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet, she can wade in a drop of dew,
She don't come and I don't follow, waits backstage while I sing to you.
{eov}

{sov: V4}
Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm, jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love in the spring, fall and winter, she can make happy any man alive
{eov}

{sov: V5}
[A]Sugar mag[G]nolia,[D][A] ringing that [G]bluebell,[D][A] caught up in [G]sunlight,[D][A]
[A]Come on out [E]singing, I'll [G]walk you in the [D]sunshine,
Come on honey, come along with [A]me.
{eov}

{sov: V6}
She's got everything delightful, she's got everything I need,
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight,
Crazy in the sunlight yes indeed.
{eov}

{sov: Chorus2}
[A]Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, when the moon is half way down,
[B]Sometimes when the [E]night is [B]dying, I take me out and
I [A]wander [E][D][A][B]around, I wander [B][A][E][B]round
{eov}

{sov: V7}
[B]Sunshine daydream, [F#]walking through the [E]tall trees.
Going where the wind goes, blooming like a red rose.
Breathing more freely. Light out singing,
I'll walk you in the morning sunshine, sunshine, daydream.
{eov}
