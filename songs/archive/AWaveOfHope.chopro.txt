{t:A Wave of Hope}
{st: Phish}

{c: Cm F Cm F Eb (Quickly bounce back and fourth between these chords)}

From out of the chaos a wave appears
In the moonlit confusion
Irons melted, coming Grace, no longer frozen

The pillow drowns the moans and shallow breaths
As dancing silvery rays change, each wave eyes a star
And the swollen moon hangs over the water

Reflections guide the way, gold maze mirrors
As the night wheels turn
Shipwrecks sway, steel mast crashes, spin green sky

Cm                          F
I have grown my wings, I am flying
Eb                   Bb >   B >
Ascending now, I am soaring
Cm                    F
Untied my wrists, and flew away
Eb                   Bb >   B >
This too shall pass, this too shall pass

G
We are flying, we are flying
         Bb Ab
Over the water
G
We are diving, we are diving
          C#
Into the water

{c: Repeat chorus, jam over verse chords}
