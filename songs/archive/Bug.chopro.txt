{t: Bug}
{st: Phish}

There've been times that I've wondered
And times that I don't
Concepts I'll ponder
And concepts I won't ever see
God is not one of these
Former or latter
Which did you think I meant
It doesn't matter to me

Bug, Don't need it
Bug, Don't feed it
Bug, Thoughts faded
Overrated


Gold in my hand
In a country pool
Standing and waving
The rain, wind on the runway
Spending or saving
Credit or death
Which did you think I meant
Nothing I see can be taken from me
