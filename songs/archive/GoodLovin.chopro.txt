I was feeling so bad. Asked my family doctor about what I had.
I said, Doctor (Doctor), Mister MD (Doctor),
Can you tell me (Doctor) what's ailing me?
He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (yeah...)
All you need, all you really need, is Good Lovin'

So come on baby, squeeze me tight
Don't you, don't you want me to be alright?
I said baby (baby), it's for sure (baby),
I got the fever, (baby) you got the cure.

He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (yeah...)
All you need, all you really need: Good lovin'

Gimme, gimme, gimme some lovin'
Hey, now you got to have lovin'
You need it, I need it, got to have lovin'

Hey, now you got to have lovin'.
