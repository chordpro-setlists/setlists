{t: Dirt}
{st: Phish}


Washed up on shore

I'd like to live beneath the dirt
A tiny space to move and breathe
is all that I would ever need
I want live beneath the dirt
where I am free from push and shove
like all those swarming up above
beneath your heals I'll spend my time

(shout your name into the wind) I'll wiggle in the earth and dew
(shout your name into the wind) and somtimes I will think of you
(shout your name into the wind) And if you ever think of me
Kneel down and kiss the earth and show me what this thought is worth
I'll never hear your voice again

Shout your name into the wind
