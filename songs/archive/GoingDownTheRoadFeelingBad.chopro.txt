{t:Going Down the Road Feeling Bad}
{st:Woody Guthrie}

Going down the road feeling bad. (x3)
I don't want to be treated this away.

{cb: Vocals: PJ}
Going where the climate suits my clothes. (x3)
I don't want to be treated this away.
(Chorus)
{cb: Lead: PJ}

{cb: Vocals: MV}
Going where the water tastes like wine. (x3)
I don't want to be treated this away.
(Chorus)
{cb: Lead: MV}

{cb: Vocals: MS}
Going where the chilly winds don't blow. (x3)
I don't want to be treated this away.
(Chorus)
{cb: Lead: MS}

{cb: Chorus 2x... "treated this ol WAYYY.."}

{cb: Full stop, Steve starts NFA Drum, PJ cue the break}
{cb: NFA: wind down to acapella}
