Dear Mr. Fantasy play us a tune,
Something to make us all happy.
Do anything to keep us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy.
You are the one who makes us all glad
But doing that, you break down in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight life you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years.
