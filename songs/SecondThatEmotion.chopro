Maybe you want to give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
And maybe you'll go away and never call
A taste of honey is worse than none at all

{sov: Chorus}
Oh in that case I don't want no part
That that would only break my heart
But if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion, I second that emotion
If you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
{eov}

{sov: V2}
Maybe you think that love would tie you down
You don't have the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made for fools
And so it makes you wise to break the rules
