"There must be some kinda way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There’s too much confusion,
I can’t get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine,
Plow men dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth"

"No reason to get excited"
The thief he kindly spoke
"There are many here among
Us who feel that life is but a joke
But, you and I, we’ve been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now,
Because the hour is getting late"

All along the watchtower
Princes kept their view
While other women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the cold distance
A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl.
