If you go down to Deep Elem
Put your money in your shoes
The women in Deep Elem
Got them Deep Elem blues

Oh, sweet Mama,
Your Daddy's got them Deep Elem Blues
Oh, sweet Mama,
Your Daddy's got them Deep Elem Blues

Once I had a girlfriend
She meant the world to me
She went down to Deep Elem
Now she ain't what she used to be
{eov}

Once I knew a preacher
Preached the bible through and through
He went down to Deep Elem,
Now his preaching days are through
{eov}

{sov: V4}
When you go down to Deep Elem
To have a little fun
Have your ten dollars ready
When the police man comes
{eov}

{sov: V5}
When you go down to Deep Elem
Put your money in your pants
Cause the women in Deep Elem
They don't give a man a chance
{eov}
