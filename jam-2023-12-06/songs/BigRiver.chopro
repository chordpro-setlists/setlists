{sov: Chorus}
Well I [A]taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry,
Taught the clouds how to cover up a [B]clear blue sky.[E]
[A]Tears I cried for that woman are gonna [D]flood you big river,
And [A]I'm a gonna sit right [E7]here until I [A]die.
{eov}

{sov: V1}
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota,
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl that southern drawl.
Well I heard my dream went back downstream, cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you big river when you called.
{eov}

<i>Chorus</i>

{sov: V2}
Well I followed her down to St. Lou, later on down the river,
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
Well I followed her down to Memphis, but she just walked off the bus,
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone.
{eov}

<i>Chorus</i>

{sov: V3}
Well I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on,
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
I give up, I've had enough, followed my blues on down to the gulf,
She loves you big river more than me.
{eov}
